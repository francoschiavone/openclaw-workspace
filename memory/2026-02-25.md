## Naming Research (all night, ~1AM-7AM)

### Round 1-3: Systematic generation
- Generated ~21K names programmatically (CVCV, Latin/Greek roots, compounds)
- Filtered to 5K by brand-quality score
- Checked ~3500 .ai domains via `@wearebravelabs/domain-checker-mcp` (DNS+RDAP)
- Found 588 available .ai domains — saved to Obsidian `00-Inbox/Naming-Research/`
- Sub-agents (GLM-5) hit rate limits repeatedly — had to do most work myself (Opus)
- Sub-agents also lied about domain availability — verified everything myself after that

### Round 4: Fresh creative approach
- Spawned GLM-5 agent with Lexicon Branding methodology
- Produced 395 names (naming-final-round-fresh.md)
- Research on how Stripe, Netflix, Anthropic, Kodak got their names

### Round 5: Style-matched to Franco's preferences
- Franco's favorite style: Framara/Notara/Meridoc (3 syllables, stress on 2nd, Latin/Italian feel)
- Franco likes: Netflix, Stripe, Anthropic, Intel, Oracle, Oreo, BIC, Amazon
- Wants: trust, dynamism, innovation. Can be abstract.
- Generated style-matched names and verified domains

### Key findings & Franco's reactions
- **Meridoc.ai** ✅ available — Franco's original favorite, has "doc dot ai" clash + Tolkien concern
- **Framara.ai** ✅ available — Franco owns framara.com, solid but doesn't excite him
- **Notara.ai** ❌ taken — Franco really liked this one ("note" + ara), was disappointed
- **Guvuo.com** — Franco owns, I advised against (hard to spell/pronounce)
- **Pluright.com** — Franco owns, too similar to Pluralsight
- Soft/flowy names (Meriva, Lucenda, Soliva) → rejected, "too soft"
- Sharp/punchy names (Zarko, Grako, Zrox) → rejected, "too weird and hard to pronounce"
- Best available alternatives to Notara: Lectara.ai, Fontara.ai, Notura.ai, Meridok.ai
- My recommendation: Meridoc.ai (told Franco "Framara is safe, Meridoc is correct")
- **No final decision made** — Franco still thinking

### All naming research saved to Obsidian
- `00-Inbox/Naming-Research/01-Research-v1-Naming-Patterns.md`
- `00-Inbox/Naming-Research/02-Research-v2-Deep-120-Names.md`
- `00-Inbox/Naming-Research/03-Research-v3-Fresh-395-Names.md`
- `00-Inbox/Naming-Research/04-588-Available-AI-Domains.md`
- `00-Inbox/Naming-Research/05-Style-Framara-Notara-Meridoc.md`

## Idea Captured
- AI Meeting Flowchart App — app that listens to meetings and generates flowcharts in real time
- Saved to Obsidian `00-Inbox/AI-Meeting-Flowchart-App.md`

## Google Auth
- Attempted `gog auth add` 3 times from inside container
- Fails because OAuth callback goes to container's localhost, not Mac Mini's browser
- Franco needs to run it from Mac Mini directly (or via `docker exec`)
- Gave him the command to run

## New Behavioral Decisions (saved to decisions.md)
- **Proactivity**: Be MUCH more proactive — propose business ideas, automations, improvements
- **LinkedIn content**: Study Franco's posts/style, daily scan for trending topics, propose posts
- **Bootstrap interview**: Franco wants to do it eventually, remind him

## New Cron Jobs Created
- Apple Music free trial reminder: May 20, 22, 24 (before May 25 renewal, $3.29/mo)
- Apple TV free trial reminder: May 20, 22, 24 (before May 25 renewal, $6.99/mo)
- LinkedIn daily scan: every day 10AM, only message if something worth posting
- Domains setup reminder: Wednesdays 6PM (francoschiavone.ai + franco@schiavone.ai)
- Obsidian organization reminder: Saturdays 7PM
- Bootstrap interview reminder: today 6PM (one-shot)

## Cron Job: OpenClaw update reminder
- Still active (daily) — Franco already updated to 2026.2.24, should disable this

## Infrastructure
- OpenClaw updated + security hardened by Franco
- WhatsApp had several brief disconnects (499) — all auto-reconnected
- Model status: OK all session (Opus 4.6 via setup-token, free)
- GitHub backup ran successfully at 3AM (commit c83a0df)
- iCloud backup: last ran Feb 24 10:00 UTC

## System
- Obsidian sync cron had a timeout error (last run)
- GLM-5 rate limits: running 3+ parallel sub-agents causes 429 errors consistently

## Evening Session (~1PM-9PM)

### Naming Research Continued

#### Requirements evolved significantly (v4):
- Up to 12 letters (was 6-7)
- No syllable/stress restrictions
- No B/V (sound same in Spanish), no K (use C before a/o/u)
- No J, H, G before e/i, C before e/i
- NO words in recognizable Spanish
- Can be Italian, Latin, English arcaic, or invented words that sound real
- Removed hard NOs on soft/pharma/Tolkien/diminutive/Italian-only
- Full requirements saved in `memory/bank/tasks/naming-requirements-v4.md`

#### ~600 names checked in this session across multiple rounds:
1. Notara-adjacent variations → Franco rejected ("knockoffs")
2. Italian verb roots (cavara, levara, etc.) → rejected
3. Real Italian words (lettura, decifra) → rejected (hard to pronounce/spell)
4. 200 batch with C+a/o/u allowed → mostly too constructed
5. 200 batch of real Spanish words → Franco liked "destral" but said NO Spanish words
6. 200 batch non-Spanish (Italian/Latin/arcaic/invented) → best results

#### Franco's Top 3 favorites:
1. **Alderon** — al-DE-ron — fuerte, memorable, .ai available
2. **Destral** — des-TRAL — afilado, preciso, .ai available (but destral.ai needs recheck — "destra.ai" was taken)
3. **Tormund** — tor-MUND — fuerte, nórdico, .ai available

#### Pattern Franco likes:
- Herramienta/fortaleza/fuerza feel
- Anglo/Nórdico > Italiano/Latino
- Likes "Adobe" as brand example (real word, short, unmistakable)
- NOT recognizable Spanish words

#### Other notable available .ai domains found:
- tractum.ai (Latin "extract"), fonderia.ai (foundry IT), araldo.ai (herald IT)
- cormont.ai, sternon.ai, falcrest.ai, nordfeld.ai, gladron.ai
- mantello.ai, portello.ai, mondello.ai, formello.ai

### New Tasks/Crons

### Infra
