## Domain Hunting (exhaustive, all day)

### Tool Discovery
- Installed `@wearebravelabs/domain-checker-mcp` via npm — uses DNS + RDAP/WHOIS fallback chain
- **This is the reliable tool** — previous whois script had ~70% false positives for .ai domains
- Usage: `mcporter call --stdio "npx @wearebravelabs/domain-checker-mcp" check_domains --args '{"domains":[...],"filter":"available"}'`
- Located at `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/tools/node_modules/@wearebravelabs/domain-checker-mcp`
- Also installed `domain-search-mcp` (didn't work well)

### Results
- **~2300 domains checked** across 3 rounds (v1, v2, v3)
- **v1**: general scan — 750 domains, found ~280 available (compound names, not single words)
- **v2**: resale-focused — 1550 domains, focused on trending 2026 terms, crypto, cybersecurity, agritech
- **v3**: Digital Twins + Agro + Simulation — 800 domains, Franco's SimulAI project focus
- **Key finding**: ALL 4-6 letter single English word .ai domains are TAKEN. Zero exceptions.
- Reports saved: `domain-hunt-VERIFIED.md`, `domain-hunt-VERIFIED-v2.md`, `domain-hunt-VERIFIED-v3-twins-agro.md`
- Old unreliable reports and scripts deleted per Franco's request

### Top domains found (confirmed available)
- **Agro/Twins**: agrotwin.ai, farmtwin.ai, croptwin.ai, aisimulate.ai, iottwin.ai, carbontwin.ai
- **Franco's expertise**: ocrflow.ai, parsecraft.ai, ragcraft.ai, ocrify.ai, docintelli.ai
- **Personal**: fschiavone.ai, francos.ai, francollm.com, docsprints.com
- **Resale**: arbitragebot.ai, pentestbot.ai, croppredict.ai, videoparse.ai

### ⚠️ .ai price increase March 5 — $20/yr increase (14%)

## Google OAuth Token Expired
- `gog` commands fail with `invalid_grant: Token has been expired or revoked`
- Franco needs to run: `gog auth add francoaschiavone@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,drive,contacts,docs,sheets`
- Bass Chiropractic tracking cron failed due to this
- Informed Franco multiple times, not yet re-authenticated

## Bass Chiropractic Order #1353
- Franco asked me to draft email to Josh requesting shipping info for Aerobox prealerta
- Drafted and approved: tracking number, carrier, weight, invoice/declared value
- Saved to `memory/bank/message-examples.md`
- Aerobox prealerta requires: tracking, commercial invoice, pre-cotización from calculator
- Franco will send the email manually (Google auth expired, can't send via gog)

## Mercado Libre Coupons
- Franco asked for ML "Día de Cupones" coupons — wants furniture + electric vacuum
- Spawned 4 GLM-5 sub-agents, all completed successfully
- Key codes found: HORASLOCAS ($7K off, min $50K), LIQUIDACION ($5K off, min $55K), UNIFORME ($5K off, min $55K)
- DOBLE* codes from "Fechas Dobles" (Feb 18-19) — may be expired
- No specific 40-50% coupon codes for furniture — those are personalized in the ML app
- Best vacuum deal: Shark Matrix RV2300 (29% off), Daewoo Moppy (44% off)
- Delivered consolidated results to Franco

## Reminders
- Franco reminded me AGAIN: when he asks for a message to send, deliver ONLY the content. Comments go in SEPARATE message. Rule already in decisions.md but I wasn't following it.
- Franco reminded me to save approved messages to message-examples.md — did so for the Josh email.
