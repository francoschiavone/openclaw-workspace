# Conclusion

The AI micro-SaaS market is not saturated—it's fracturing into niches. The most successful solo developers are:

1. **Solving boring problems** that incumbents ignore
2. **Building fast** with tools they already know
3. **Charging immediately** to validate demand
4. **Leveraging distribution** through content/communities
5. **Focusing on narrow verticals** where they can be #1

For Franco specifically, the intersection of document AI + Latin American market + agentic workflows presents a unique opportunity. The skills are there. The market gaps exist. The question is: which problem will you solve first?
