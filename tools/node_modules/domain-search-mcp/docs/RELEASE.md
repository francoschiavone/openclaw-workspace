# Release Workflow

Use this flow to publish safely and keep MCP clients stable.

## Checklist

- Bump versions in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `server.json`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` (add a new version section).
- Run `npm run test` (or at least `npm run build`).
- Ensure GitHub secret `NPM_TOKEN` is set (used by CI).
- Label PRs so Release Drafter can generate clean notes (see below).
- Confirm no secrets are included in the package (`npm pack --dry-run` if needed).

## Canary Publish (Local)

Publish a canary build for quick validation:

```bash
npm run release:canary
```

Smoke test the canary in a local MCP client. If it behaves correctly, promote it.

## Promote to Latest (Local)

```bash
npm run release:promote-latest
```

Or publish directly as latest:

```bash
npm run release:latest
```

## CI Release (Recommended)

Create a git tag and push it. CI will publish with provenance and create a GitHub Release:

```bash
git tag v1.2.24
git push origin v1.2.24
```

## Release Drafter Labels

Use these labels so release notes are auto-generated cleanly:

- `breaking`
- `feature`, `enhancement`
- `fix`, `bug`
- `docs`
- `chore`, `refactor`
- `security`

Use `skip-changelog` to exclude a PR from release notes.

## Notes

- CI publishes with `--provenance` for supply-chain integrity.
- Local scripts use `--provenance` if supported; otherwise publish without provenance.
- Prefer canary first for risky changes (protocol updates, new tool outputs).
- If a release is bad, use `npm deprecate` and promote the previous version.
