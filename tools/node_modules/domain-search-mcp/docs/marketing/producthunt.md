## First Comment (Maker's Comment):
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the maker of Domain Search MCP.

The problem: I use Claude constantly for brainstorming. Every time I come up with a project name, I have to leave Claude, open a domain registrar, check if it's available, and then go back to report the result. This breaks my flow.

The solution: An MCP server that lets Claude check domains directly. Now I just ask "Is coolname.com available?" and Claude tells me instantly — with pricing from multiple registrars.

This is open source (MIT license) and works with Claude Desktop. Would love your feedback!

Try it: npx @anthropic/claude-code mcp add domain-search-mcp
