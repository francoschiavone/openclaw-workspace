Show HN: Domain Search MCP – AI-powered domain availability checker for Claude
```

```

## Text (optional, for self-posts):
```
I built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets Claude check domain availability in real-time.

Why? I was tired of context-switching between Claude and domain registrars while brainstorming project names. Now I just ask Claude "Is vibecoding.com available?" and it checks Porkbun, Namecheap, RDAP, and WHOIS in seconds.

Features:
- Check availability + pricing across multiple TLDs
- Compare prices between registrars
- Sherlock-style social handle checking (10 platforms)
- Premium domain detection with "why it's premium" insights
- Domain expiration tracking for taken domains

Works with zero config (uses public RDAP/WHOIS), or add registrar API keys for pricing.

Built with TypeScript, 98 tests, security audited. Open source, MIT license.

Would love feedback on the architecture or feature requests!
