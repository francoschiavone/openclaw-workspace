I got tired of leaving Claude every time I needed to check if a domain was available.

So I built an MCP server that does it for me.

Now I just ask: "Is vibecoding.com available?"

🧵 Here's what I built (open source):

Domain Search MCP connects Claude to:

• Porkbun (with pricing)
• Namecheap (with pricing)
• RDAP (50+ TLDs)
• WHOIS (fallback)

One question → multiple sources checked in seconds.

But domains aren't enough.

I added Sherlock-style social handle checking.

One command checks 10 platforms:
✅ GitHub, npm, PyPI, Reddit (high confidence)
⚠️ Twitter, YouTube, ProductHunt (medium)
🔒 Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok (verify manually)
```

```
Premium domains now tell you WHY they're expensive:

💎 "ai.io is $5000 (125x standard pricing)"

"Why premium: Two-character domain, Popular keyword, High-demand TLD"

"Try instead: getai.io, aihq.io, ai.dev"
```

```
For taken domains, it shows expiration dates:

🕐 "coolstartup.com expires in 23 days"

Useful if you're watching a domain.
