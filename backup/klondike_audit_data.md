## OBSERVATIONS FOR AUDIT

### Red Flags / Items to Verify:

1. **Cherry-Picking:** Premium results highlight wins but rarely mention losses
2. **Leverage Multipliers:** Profit claims often include high leverage (x10-x25)
3. **Entry Zones:** Often wide ranges that can be retroactively claimed as "filled"
4. **Signal Tracking:** No independent verification of all signals
5. **Edited Posts:** Several posts noted as "edited" - potential result manipulation
6. **High Accuracy Claims:** 87% accuracy with 84% avg ROE seems unrealistic long-term

### Inconsistencies Noted:

1. January 2026 public signals show 100% accuracy - statistically unlikely
2. $HYPE: 42/43 profitable (97.7%) over 3 months - extraordinary claim
3. Multiple "all targets reached" claims without showing original signal entries
4. Profit percentages sometimes stated without clarifying if leverage included

### Deleted/Edited Posts:
- Post 11884: Marked as "edited"
- Post 11782: Marked as "edited"
- Post 10995: Easter discount post (promotional)
