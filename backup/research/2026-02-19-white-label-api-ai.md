## 5. Pricing & Economics

### White-Label Pricing Models Compared

| Model | Your Cost | Agency Margin | Best For |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Revenue Share (30-50%)** | $0 upfront | 30-50% | New agencies, testing market |
| **Flat Monthly Fee** | $99-500/month | 70-90% | Established agencies, predictable |
| **Per-Client Pricing** | $20-50/client | 80-95% | Scaling agencies |
| **Usage-Based Only** | Variable | Variable | API-first products |
| **Enterprise License** | $1,000-5,000/month | Custom | Large agencies, BPOs |

### Example Pricing Calculation

```
Platform cost: $200/month (supports 10 clients)
Cost per client: $20/month
Agency charges: $100/month per client
Total revenue: $1,000/month
Gross margin: 80% ($800 profit)
Margin multiple: 5x
```

### AI SaaS Gross Margin Benchmarks

## 6. Technical Architecture for Multi-Tenant AI

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Fundamentals

**Definition:** Multiple customers share the same application while maintaining their own data, configuration, and branding.

### Key Architecture Patterns

```
Pattern 1: Shared Infrastructure, Logical Isolation
├── Single database, tenant_id column
├── Row-level security
├── Shared model instances
└── Lowest cost, highest density

Pattern 2: Shared App, Tenant-Specific Models
├── Shared application layer
├── Per-tenant model fine-tuning
├── Isolated vector stores
└── Medium cost, customization

Pattern 3: Isolated Infrastructure (Enterprise)
├── Dedicated compute per tenant
├── Separate databases
├── Custom model deployments
└── Highest cost, maximum isolation
```

### Multi-Tenant AI Considerations

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Data Isolation** | Tenant-scoped queries, row-level security |
| **Model Customization** | Per-tenant system prompts, RAG, fine-tuning |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-tenant quotas, tiered limits |
| **Cost Attribution** | Token metering per tenant, usage dashboards |
| **Branding** | Dynamic theming, custom domains, white-label UI |
| **Compliance** | Data residency, encryption, audit logs |

### Tech Stack Recommendations

```
API Gateway:
- Rate limiting, authentication
- Usage metering, billing integration
- Options: Kong, Zuplo, AWS API Gateway

Orchestration:
- LangGraph, LangChain, LlamaIndex
- Multi-model routing
- Prompt management

Infrastructure:
- Kubernetes for scaling

- Vector storage usage
- API call volume
- Fine-tuning costs
- Caching hit rates

**Align pricing with architecture:**
- Set plan limits based on actual costs
- Make overages explicit and billable
- Dashboard visibility for tenants
