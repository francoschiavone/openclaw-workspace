## Part 3: Pricing Models That Convert

### What Works in 2025-2026

**Hybrid Pricing Dominates:**
- 91% of SaaS use usage-based or hybrid models
- Hybrid models show stronger revenue performance than flat plans
- Base subscription + usage tiers = predictable revenue + upside

### Proven Pricing Patterns

| Model | Best For | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Base + Credits** | AI tools with variable compute | $29/mo + $0.005/generation |
| **Tiered by Volume** | Document processing | $49/100 docs, $99/500 docs |
| **Outcome-Based** | Support/automation | $0.99 per resolved ticket (Intercom) |
| **Per-Seat + Usage** | Team tools | $30/user + credits for AI calls |
| **Workflow-Based** | Task automation | $X per completed task |

### Key Pricing Insights

1. **Annual plans cut churn by 30%** and increase LTV by 27%
2. **14-day free trials** convert better than freemium for B2B
3. **$79/month is painkiller pricing** - $19/month is vitamin pricing
4. **Outcome-based pricing** ($0.99/resolution) creates perfect value alignment
5. **Hide tokens from customers** - anchor pricing on workflows/outcomes

### Pricing Strategy Framework

```
For AI Micro-SaaS:
├── Entry: $29-$49/month (or 14-day free trial)
├── Growth: $99-$199/month  
├── Scale: $299-$499/month
└── Enterprise: Custom

Usage add-ons:
├── Per-document: $0.10-$0.50

## Part 4: Technical Feasibility for Solo Developers

### What One Person CAN Build and Maintain

**Proven Solo Tech Stacks:**
- **Django + React + Docker** (classic, reliable)
- **Next.js + Supabase + Vercel** (modern, fast)
- **Python/FastAPI + React + Railway** (AI-friendly)
- **Node.js + Firebase** (quick to ship)

### Infrastructure Cost Reality

| Stage | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| MVP | $0-$50 | Free tiers (Vercel, Supabase, etc.) |
| Early Traction | $100-$500 | Basic hosting + AI API calls |
| $10K MRR | $500-$2,000 | Scaling infrastructure |
| $50K MRR | $2,000-$10,000 | Production-grade setup |

### AI API Costs (2026)
- **GPT-4o:** $2.50/$10 per million tokens (input/output)
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** $3/$15 per million tokens
- **Gemini Pro:** $1.25/$5 per million tokens
- **Open-source (Llama 3.1):** ~$0.10-$0.50 per million tokens (self-hosted)

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Use smaller models** for simple tasks (classification, extraction)
2. **Cache embeddings** for RAG - don't re-embed unchanged documents
3. **Batch processing** instead of real-time where possible
4. **Use AI internally first** before adding customer-facing features
5. **Start with hosted APIs**, optimize to self-hosted only at scale

### Solo Developer Architecture

```
Frontend: Next.js on Vercel (free-$20/mo)
├── Database: Supabase (free-$25/mo)
├── AI Processing: 
│   ├── Simple: OpenAI/Anthropic API ($50-$500/mo)
