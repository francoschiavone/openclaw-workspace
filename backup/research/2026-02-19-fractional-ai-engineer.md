## 1. What is "Fractional" Engineering?

### Definition
A fractional engineer/executive provides part-time, ongoing expertise to multiple companies simultaneously. Unlike:
- **Consultants:** Project-based, transactional, defined scope
- **Interim:** Full-time but temporary
- **Fractional:** Ongoing, part-time, embedded in the company

### How It Works in Practice

**Typical Engagement Structure:**
- **Hours per week:** 10-25 hours per client (most common: 1-2 days/week)
- **Number of clients:** 2-4 simultaneously (allows ~40-50 total hours/week)
- **Duration:** 3 months to several years (avg: 6-18 months)
- **Engagement types:**
  - Advisory (5-10 hrs/month): Strategic guidance only
  - Active (10-25 hrs/week): Hands-on + strategy
  - Intensive (30+ hrs/week): Critical phases, product launches

**Common Structures:**
1. **Monthly Retainer** (most common): $3,000-$15,000/month for set hours
2. **Hourly Rate:** $150-$500/hour (US), $45-$85/hour (LatAm general)
3. **Project-Based:** $5,000-$50,000 for defined deliverables
4. **Hybrid:** Retainer + equity (common for early-stage startups: 50/50 split)

## 4. Finding Clients

### The #1 Rule: Your Network is Everything

**84% of fractional leaders find their first client from their network.**

### Step-by-Step Client Acquisition Strategy

#### Phase 1: Network Activation (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Export LinkedIn contacts** and categorize:
   - Direct work references (former bosses, colleagues)
   - Well-connected contacts (VCs, founders, recruiters)
   - Fractional peers (people already doing this)

2. **Private outreach:**
   - Schedule coffee chats with top 20 contacts
   - Goal: Pitch practice + potential first client
   - Ask for feedback, not clients directly

3. **Refine your positioning:**
   - What's your niche? (AI for SaaS, AI for FinTech, etc.)
   - What size companies? (Seed, Series A, Series B)
   - What's your unique value proposition?

#### Phase 2: Public Launch (Week 4-6)
1. **LinkedIn announcement post:**
   - What kind of fractional are you
   - Types of clients you're a GREAT fit for
   - Recent work examples
   - Unique experiences that qualify you
   - Call to action

2. **Update LinkedIn profile:**
   - Headline: "Fractional AI Engineer | Helping [target companies] [achieve outcome] | Ex-[notable companies]"
   - About section: Clear services, target client, proof points

#### Phase 3: Ongoing Lead Generation (Ongoing)
1. **Content posting:** Once/week minimum
   - Thought leadership in your niche
   - Stories from past work (anonymized)
   - Behind-the-scenes of fractional work
   - Client wins and milestones

2. **Channel partners:**
   - VCs/PE firms (introduce to portfolio companies)
   - Startup accelerators (YC, Techstars alumni networks)
   - Agencies (complementary services)
   - Other fractional leaders (referral agreements: 5-10% commission)

3. **Communities:**
   - Industry-specific Slack groups
   - Function-specific forums (AI/ML communities)
   - Ex-employee groups
   - Paid executive communities

4. **Talent marketplaces:**
   - [Fractional Jobs](https://fractionaljobs.io) - fractional-specific
   - [A.Team](https://a.team) - elite engineer network
   - [Gun.io](https://gun.io) - senior developers
   - [Toptal](https://toptal.com) - top 3% freelancers
   - [HireFraction](https://hirefraction.com) - US-based fractional

### Lead Generation Timeline
- **Week 1-4:** Network activation, private outreach
- **Month 1-3:** First client (typical)
- **Month 3-6:** 2-3 clients established
- **Month 6+:** Referrals start compounding

---

## 5. Legal and Practical Considerations

### Working for Multiple Companies: Conflict of Interest?

**General Rule:** Working for multiple companies is legal and common. However:

✅ **Safe:**
- Different industries (no competition)
- Different functions within same industry
- Full transparency with all parties
- Strong NDAs in place

⚠️ **Requires Caution:**
- Direct competitors in same space
- Same function at competing companies
- Access to sensitive strategic info at both

❌ **Avoid:**
- Working with direct competitors simultaneously
- Using confidential info from one client for another
- Any situation where you'd have to choose sides

**Best Practice:** Disclose all other clients (by industry, not name) in contracts. Most clients only care that you're not helping their direct competitors.

### Argentina-Specific Considerations

**Tax Implications:**
- As an Argentine tax resident, you pay Argentine income tax on worldwide income
- US companies typically pay as contractor (no US tax withholding)
- US company files 1099-NEC for payments >$600/year
- Argentina has tax treaties to avoid double taxation
- **Important:** Consult with Argentine tax advisor for specifics

**Contract Structures:**
1. **Direct Contractor Agreement:**
   - Simplest for US companies
   - You handle your own taxes in Argentina
   - Standard independent contractor terms

2. **Through an EOR (Employer of Record):**
   - Companies like Deel, Remote, Oyster handle compliance
   - More complex, but some clients prefer it
   - You'd be technically "employed" by the EOR

3. **Via Your Own Company:**
   - Set up an Argentine entity (simpler than it sounds)
   - B2B contract between your company and client
   - Better for liability protection

**Payment Methods:**
- Wise (formerly TransferWise) - popular, good rates
- PayPal - universal but higher fees
- Direct wire transfer (SWIFT)
- US bank account (if you have one)

### NDA and IP Handling

**Standard Approach:**
- Each client provides their NDA
- Sign it, but read carefully for:
  - Overly broad non-compete clauses
  - IP claims on your pre-existing work
  - Restrictions on using general skills/knowledge

**Your Protection:**
- Keep a list of your "pre-existing IP" (tools, frameworks, knowledge)
- Ensure contracts only claim IP for work done specifically for them
- Maintain clear separation between client work

### Current Employer (LumberFi) Considerations

**Before starting:**
1. Review your employment contract for:
   - Moonlighting clauses
   - Non-compete provisions
   - IP ownership terms
   - Exclusivity requirements

2. Common approaches:
   - **Full transparency:** Tell LumberFi about fractional work
   - **Outside hours:** Only work outside LumberFi hours
   - **Non-competing:** Only work with non-competitive companies
   - **Different tech:** Focus on different AI applications

3. Many companies allow side work if:
   - It doesn't compete with their business
   - It doesn't use company resources/time
   - It doesn't affect your performance

## 6. Positioning and Branding

### LinkedIn Headline Formula

**Best Format:** "[Role] | [Target Client] | [Outcome You Deliver] | [Credibility]"

**Examples:**
- "Fractional AI Engineer | Helping Series A SaaS ship AI features 3x faster | Ex-LumberFi, ML Specialist"
- "AI Engineering Leader (Fractional) | Building production ML systems for fintech startups | 8 years exp"
- "Fractional Head of AI | Turning AI strategy into shipped products | Python, LangGraph, ML"

### Personal Website Elements

**Essential Pages:**
1. **Homepage:** Clear value proposition + target client + proof
2. **Services:** Tiered packages with pricing (or "contact for pricing")
3. **Case Studies:** 3-5 detailed examples (problem → approach → results)
4. **About:** Your story, credentials, why fractional
5. **Contact:** Simple form + calendar link (Cal.com or Calendly)

**Good Examples:**
- [albertosadde.com](https://albertosadde.com/fractional-cto) - Clean, outcome-focused
- [fractional.ai](https://fractional.ai) - Company site, but good positioning

### Thought Leadership Content

**What to Post About:**
1. **Technical insights:** How you solved a specific AI problem
2. **Strategic takes:** Opinions on AI trends, what works/doesn't
3. **Behind-the-scenes:** How you work as a fractional
4. **Client wins:** Success stories (with permission, anonymized)
5. **Lessons learned:** Mistakes you've seen/made, how to avoid

**Posting Cadence:**
- Start: 1-2 posts/month
- Build to: 1-2 posts/week
- Engage: Comment on others' posts daily

**Content Types:**
- LinkedIn posts (text + image)
- LinkedIn articles (longer form)
- Twitter/X threads
- Blog posts on your site
- Guest posts on industry publications

### Positioning Statement Template

> "I help [target companies] [achieve specific outcome] through [your expertise]. 
> 
> Unlike [alternatives], I [unique differentiator].
> 
> I've [credibility proof points]."

**Example for Franco:**
> "I help Series A-C SaaS companies ship production AI features in weeks, not months.
> 
> Unlike dev agencies that hand off black-box solutions, I embed with your team and build alongside them—transferring knowledge so you own the capability.
> 
> I've spent [X] years building AI systems at LumberFi and [other companies], with expertise in Python, LangGraph, and ML infrastructure. Currently based in Argentina, working US hours."
