1. **English & Personality Screening** - Initial video call
2. **Technical Skills Review** - Domain-specific assessment
3. **Live Coding Challenge** - Timed coding test
4. **Test Project** - 1-2 week unpaid project (controversial)
5. **Final Review** - Team evaluation

### Acceptance Rate
- **Claimed:** ~3% (often cited in marketing)

### Cons
- **Unpaid 2-week test project** (major complaint)

- Platform takes significant cut
- Some report interviewers from lower-cost regions
- Mixed reviews on project quality/availability

### User Experiences (Reddit)

**Negative experience (r/freelance, 2018):**
> "I had read horror stories about how toptal interviewers intentionally fail applicants to keep their competition pool small... The final question was to create 5 related tables with referential integrity, populate with sample data, then write 3 specific semi-complex queries...all in 20 minutes. I've been doing this for years and nobody could pull that off."

**On the screening process (r/freelance, 2017):**
> "I find free labor and exploitation of any kind to be offensive to professional designers and engineers like myself. Your requirement of an unpaid 2 week long assignment 'test' is completely exploitative and disrespectful to potential freelancers."

## Recommendations for Franco

### Best Match: A.Team + Turing
Given your AI Engineer profile at LumberFi with Python, TypeScript, ML, and LangGraph experience:

1. **A.Team** - Apply or network to get invited. Their AI systems focus and enterprise clients align perfectly.

2. **Turing** - Strong AI/ML focus with LLM post-training work. Create a profile emphasizing your ML and LangGraph experience.

### Secondary Options:

3. **Gun.io** - Set up a profile. Zero fees mean you keep your rate. Good for steady backend/ML work.

4. **Braintrust** - Consider if you want to keep 100% of earnings and don't mind Web3 complexity.

### Skip or Approach with Caution:

5. **Toptal** - The unpaid 2-week test is a significant investment with mixed ROI. Only if you want the brand recognition.

6. **Lemon.io** - Likely to undervalue your AI/ML expertise. Better for generalist senior devs.
